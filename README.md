## Overview

The **Local Disaster Response Coordination Platform** is a mobile and web application aimed at improving disaster response efforts. The platform allows users within a specific region to report disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and other emergencies. The app enables users to share crucial information, resources, and coordinate rescue operations to facilitate effective disaster management. By leveraging real-time data, this platform helps users stay informed, offer aid, and assist in emergency evacuations.

## Problem Statement

In disaster-stricken areas, it is critical to have real-time information on the situation to save lives and deploy resources efficiently. Current communication systems are often fragmented, and information sharing can be delayed, which hinders the response. Our platform addresses this issue by offering a fast, collaborative system for reporting, coordinating, and supporting disaster relief efforts.

## Features

- **Real-time Reporting**: Users can report disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes) by marking affected locations on an interactive map, along with details on the severity and impact of the disaster.
- **Resource Sharing**: Users can share available resources such as medical supplies, food, and volunteer support to help those in need.
- **Push Notifications**: The app will send push notifications to users about critical updates, new reports, and available resources.
- **Map Integration**: Integrated with OpenStreetMap API, the platform provides real-time visual updates of disaster zones, evacuation routes, and safe zones.
- **Collaboration with Authorities**: The app will enable government agencies, NGOs, and local community groups to collaborate and coordinate disaster management efforts effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **React Native** for building cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android.
  - **HTML/CSS** for building the web-based version of the app (optional).

- **Backend:**
  - **Firebase** for real-time data storage, user authentication, and push notifications.
  - **OpenStreetMap API** for interactive maps, enabling real-time updates of disaster zones and affected areas.

- **Other Tools:**
  - **Push Notification Services** (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) for instant alerts and updates.
  
## Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal of the platform is to evolve into a scalable disaster management tool that can be integrated with national and international organizations. Over time, it can leverage crowd-sourced data to:

- **Map Safe Zones and Evacuation Routes**: Use real-time data to mark evacuation zones, shelters, and safe routes, improving emergency planning and
